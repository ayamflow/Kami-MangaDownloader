Kami - Manga Download for Mac OS X
==================================

Kami is a Mac OS X application intended to ease the search & download of manga chapters.

## Features
* Fetch list of chapters for the queried manga on MangaReader.net
* Download multiple chapters
* Integration with OS X notification center
* Pause/Resume download in-app (progress currently not saved if the app is quitted)
* Basic bookmarks management (save/delete URL of a specific manga)

## Roadmap
* Output file format (images, CBR/CBZ…)
* More manga sites
* Stats (number of downloads, last chapter downloaded, history…)
* Better bookmark manager (like in a web browser)
* Fluid window size
* Allow search by manga name rather than by URL
* Better design & icon
* Github page or "official" site with download link

## Changelog
* v0.1.0 : First working version, only compatible with MangaReader.net for now.

## Acknowledgement
Kami (which, by the way, means "Paper" but also "God" in japanese) was intended to be an OS X version of [MangaRipper](mangaripper.codeplex.com) (which is Windows-only). But I intend to go a bit farther than that, in terms of UX & features. Stay tuned !
